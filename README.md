# Data Structures

After passing an inital assessment I landed an interview at Amazon. Not having a CS degree, I knew I needed to study data structures and sorting algortihms.

This is a dump of some of my implementations in JavaScript.

## Data Structures
* Binary Trees
* Hash tables (hash maps)
* Linked Lists (Singly linked list)
* Queues (First in first out)
* Stacks (First in last out)

## Binary Trees Searching Algorithms
* Pre order traversal (DFS)
* In order Traversal (DFS)
* Post order traversal (DFS)
* Breadth first search
* Min depth
* Max depth
* Max Width
